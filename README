== Goodpie: Yet Another Continuous Integration Server

Why?  Well, because the other ones suck.  Ok, maybe they don't suck but continuous integration
tends to be quite personal.  You have a specific set of things that you want it to do, usually
not a lot of things, and you want it to do them really fast.  Seriously, those builds take long
enough all on their own.  Why add to the grief?

So, this one is mine and it does the things I want it to do.  If it does the things you want it
to do as well, hooray!  If not, here are some others I like (but not as much, obviously):

* Integrity [www.integrityapp.com]
* Hudson [http://hudson.dev.java.net]
